**This is my first R markdown, and I will be messing with my options here below.** 

Here is some data preloaded onto R along with its summary

```{r}
library(carData)
data(CanPop)
summary(CanPop)
```

```{r}
library(lattice)
xyplot(CanPop$population ~ CanPop$year, ylab="Population (in Millions)", xlab="Year")
```

Through this graph, we can infer that:

* More people are living in Canada every year

* The growth is almost exponential 

* Canadians are probably nice people if people want to live there despite the cold conditions
